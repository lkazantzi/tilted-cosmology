## Abstract
...


## Instructions
### Mathematica Files
Regarding the relevant Mathematica codes, the file `Tilted Cosmology.nb` corresponds to the Mathematica code in order to obtain the results of the maximum likelihood method for all the models described in Table I. The file `Information Criteria.nb` corresponds to the calculations of Table II. The best fit results were obtained with Mathematica 11. 

### Python Files
Regarding the relevant Python codes, ....
